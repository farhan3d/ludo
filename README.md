# ludo
[ WIP ] An auto-ludo experiment in pygame.

Press spacebar to play.

Currently the only input from the user is through spacebar. Throwing a 6 only serves to free a piece, or move the farthest piece on the board.

Functionality under development:

- Ability to choose which piece to move.
- Addition of a full auto-mode in which the best possible move would be computed.
- Scoring a piece by circling the whole board.
- Visual identification of safe pieces.
